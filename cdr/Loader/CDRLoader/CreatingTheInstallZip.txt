The MSI installer proved to be waaayy more trouble than it was worth.

The new installer is a .cmd file in this directory, and a WINZIP self extracting file
that you have to build by hand:

Archive:  CDRLoaderSetup.exe
  Length     Date   Time    Name
 --------    ----   ----    ----
   303104  09-10-02 14:02   CDRLoader.exe
   139264  11-28-98 20:50   unzip.exe
      420  09-10-02 11:44   CDRLoader.ini
     1698  09-10-02 13:57   CDRLoader.lnk
      438  09-10-02 14:09   SetupCDRLoader.cmd
       13  07-16-02 16:16   CDRLoader.cmd
 --------                   -------
   444937                   6 files
   
   The .LNK file was initially created using the shortcut demo BKilne found, 
   and manually edited thereafter. 
   
   Installation instructions are as follows:
   
	1) Remove all previous version of CDRLoader, Installer etc.

	2) Execute the attached file to unzip

	3) In the directory just created run
		SetupCDRLoader.cmd
