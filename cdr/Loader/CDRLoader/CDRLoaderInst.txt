CDRLoader installation & operation instructions
[DRAFT 02.05.28 - first beta test]

Enclosed with this are two files; CDRLoader.exe and unzip.exe.
Both of these files should be copied into the XMetal directory
	C:\Program Files\SoftQuad\XMetaL 3
For conveinence and reliability a shortcut for CDRLoader should be created.
	[ Viewing the CDRLoader.exe file using Windows Explorer, right click on
	the file, select "Send To..."  "Desktop". This will create a new 
	shortcut icon on your desktop, you may rename it to suit yourself.
	Right click on the new shortcut and select "Properties".  Confirm 
	that the starting directory is "C:\Program Files\SoftQuad\XMetaL 3".
	Dismiss the properties window. You should be ready to go.]
	
If all is well, at this point you should be able to start the CDRLoader 
from the shortcut.  It will display a CDR login screen, enter your user id 
and password, then click "OK".  There will be a longer delay this first time 
as it needs to get all the CDR files, but thereafter you should only notice 
a delay if files have changed.  After the files are updated, XMetal should
start with the CDR extensions enabled.
