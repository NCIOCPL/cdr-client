   <KeyPoint>There are different types of treatment for patients with x cancer.</KeyPoint>
   <Para>Different types of treatments are available for patients with x cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. Before starting treatment, patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.</Para>
   <Para>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef cdr:xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI Web site</ExternalRef>. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.</Para>

    <KeyPoint>Surgery</KeyPoint>
    <Para>[describe surgery here]</Para>
    <Para>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to increase the chances of a cure, is called adjuvant therapy.</Para>
   </SummarySection>
   <SummarySection>
    <KeyPoint>Radiation therapy</KeyPoint>
    <Para><StandardWording>Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells. There are two types of radiation therapy.  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.  The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.</StandardWording></Para>
   </SummarySection>
   <SummarySection>
    <KeyPoint>Chemotherapy</KeyPoint>
    <Para><StandardWording>Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the spinal column, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).  The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.</StandardWording></Para>
   </SummarySection>
   <SummarySection>
    <KeyPoint>Hormone therapy</KeyPoint>
    <Para><StandardWording>Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances produced by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. The presence of some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy are used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.</StandardWording></Para>
   </SummarySection>
   <SummarySection>
    <KeyPoint>Biologic therapy</KeyPoint>
    <Para><StandardWording>Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.</StandardWording></Para>
