procedures may be used in the staging process:

<Title>Treatment Option Overview</Title>

<SummarySection>
<SectMetaData>
<SectionType>Standard treatment</SectionType>
</SectMetaData>
<KeyPoint>There are different types of treatment for  patients with X cancer.</KeyPoint>
<Para>Different types of treatments are available for  patients with X cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in <GlossaryTermRef cdr:href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef>. Before starting treatment, patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  <GlossaryTermRef cdr:href="CDR0000044930">"standard" treatment</GlossaryTermRef>, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.</Para>
<Para>Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef cdr:xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI Cancer.gov Web site</ExternalRef>. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.</Para>

<SectionType>Standard treatment</SectionType>
</SectMetaData>
<KeyPoint># types of standard treatment are used:</KeyPoint>

<SummarySection>
<KeyPoint><InterventionName>Surgery</InterventionName></KeyPoint>
<Para>[describe surgery here]</Para>
<Para>Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be offered chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after surgery, to increase the chances of a cure, is called adjuvant therapy.</Para>
</SummarySection>

<SummarySection>
<KeyPoint><InterventionName>Radiation therapy</InterventionName></KeyPoint>
<Para>Radiation therapy is the use of x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy may use external radiation (using a machine outside the body) or internal radiation. Internal radiation involves putting radioisotopes (materials that produce radiation) through thin plastic tubes into the area where cancer cells are found. X cancer is treated with _____radiation.</Para>
</SummarySection>

<SummarySection>
<KeyPoint><InterventionName>Chemotherapy</InterventionName></KeyPoint>
<Para>Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be taken by mouth, or it may be put into the body by inserting a needle into a vein or muscle. Either type of chemotherapy is called <GlossaryTermRef cdr:href="CDR0000045922">systemic therapy</GlossaryTermRef> because the drugs enter the bloodstream, travel through the body, and can kill cancer cells throughout the body. </Para>
</SummarySection>

<SummarySection>
<KeyPoint><InterventionName>Hormone therapy</InterventionName></KeyPoint>
<Para>Hormones are chemicals produced by <GlossaryTermRef cdr:href="CDR0000046386">glands</GlossaryTermRef> in the body and are circulated in the bloodstream.  <GlossaryTermRef cdr:href="CDR0000046076">Estrogen</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef cdr:href="CDR0000045158">progesterone</GlossaryTermRef> are hormones that affect the way some cancers grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have estrogen and progesterone receptors (molecules found in some cancer cells to which estrogen and progesterone will attach), hormone therapy is used to block the way these hormones help the cancer grow. This may be done by using drugs that block the way hormones work or by surgically removing organs that make hormones, such as the [ovaries or testicles].</Para>
</SummarySection>

<SummarySection>
<KeyPoint>Biological therapy</KeyPoint>
<Para><GlossaryTermRef cdr:href="CDR0000045617">Biological therapy</GlossaryTermRef> is treatment to stimulate the ability of the <GlossaryTermRef cdr:href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against disease. Biological therapy is sometimes called <GlossaryTermRef cdr:href="CDR0000045616">biological response modifier (BRM)</GlossaryTermRef> therapy or <GlossaryTermRef cdr:href="CDR0000045729">immunotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para>
