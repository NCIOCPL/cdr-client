 <SummarySection>
  <Title>What is screening?</Title>
  <Para>Screening is looking for cancer before a person has any symptoms. This can help find cancer at an early stage. When abnormal tissue or cancer is found early, it may be easier to treat. By the time symptoms appear, cancer may have begun to spread.</Para>
  <Para>Scientists are trying to better understand which people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things we do and the things around us to see if they cause cancer. This information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which screening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.</Para>
  <Para>It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily think you have cancer if he or she suggests a screening test. Screening tests are given when you have no cancer symptoms.</Para>
  <Para>If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called diagnostic tests.</Para>
  <Para>Refer to the following PDQ summaries for information about prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of X cancer.</Para>

   <KeyPoint>Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer.</KeyPoint>
   <Para>Some screening tests are used because they have been shown to be helpful both in finding cancers early and in decreasing the chance of dying from these cancers. Other tests are used because they have been shown to find cancer in some people; however, it has not been proven in clinical trials that use of these tests will decrease the risk of dying from cancer.</Para>
   <Para>Scientists study screening tests to find those with the fewest risks and most benefits. Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes symptoms) decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, finding and treating the disease at an early stage may result in a better chance of recovery.</Para>
   <Para>Clinical trials that study cancer screening methods are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef cdr:xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI Web site</ExternalRef>.</Para>

   <KeyPoint>Screening tests have risks.</KeyPoint>
   <Para>Decisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer.</Para>

   <KeyPoint>The risks of x cancer screening include the following:</KeyPoint>
   <SummarySection>
    <KeyPoint>False-negative test results can occur.</KeyPoint>
    <Para>Screening test results may appear to be normal even though x cancer is present. A person who receives a false-negative result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if there are symptoms.</Para>
   </SummarySection>
   <SummarySection>
    <KeyPoint>False-positive test results can occur.</KeyPoint>
    <Para>Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more tests and procedures (such as [tests specific to the cancer]), which also have risks.</Para>
