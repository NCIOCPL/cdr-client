     <StandardWording>Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that

         cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types 
         of radiation therapy.  External radiation therapy uses a 
         machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.  
         Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed 
         in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly 
         into or near the cancer.  The way the radiation therapy is 
         given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being

     <StandardWording>Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs 
         to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the 
         cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy 
         is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the 
         drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells 
         throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).  When chemotherapy 
         is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body 
         cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer 
         cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).  The way the 
         chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the 
         cancer being treated.</StandardWording>
