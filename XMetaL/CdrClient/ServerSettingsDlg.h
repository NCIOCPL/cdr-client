/*
 * Object for dialog window used to display and modify the values
 * for connecting with the CDR servers.  CString data members are
 * used to store each of the following:
 *
 *    - DNS name for the CDR service's server
 *    - port on which this server listens (usually 2019)
 *    - DNS name for the SOAP server (usually same as CDR server)
 *    - port on which this server listens (usually 80)
 *
 * There is a set of these four values for each of the following
 * machines:
 *
 *    - the production machine (e.g., bach.nci.nih.gov)
 *    - the test machine (e.g., franck.nci.nih.gov)
 *    - the development machine (e.g., mahler.nci.nih.gov)
 *
 * The original for this file was generated by a Visual Studio MFC
 * wizard.  Don't mess with the macros unless you really know what
 * you're doing.
